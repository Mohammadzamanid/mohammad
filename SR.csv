The factors used were Word type (congruous, incongruous), Group (control, MCI non convertors, MCI convertors) and Time window (0-500 ms or 400-500 ms, and 500-1000 ms). For analyses of the effects of repeated word presentation we also used Word repetition, by contrasting the 1st, 2nd and 3rd presentations. Frequency ranges as well as time windows were guided by previous research.

the remaining variables were tested using one-way analyses of variance (ANOVAs) with group (HO, aMCI-s, 
and aMCI-c) as the between-subjects factor. Results derived from the memory task were evaluated with a mixed

EEG oscillations. We first computed the partial-least square (PLS) at the sensor level to identify the strongest 
statistical effects in frequency, time, and space domains simultaneously, by using the PLScmd Matlab toolbox 
(http://www.rotman-baycrest.on.ca/pls/). This multivariate statistical technique attempts to explain the covari ance between two blocks of explanatory (i.e., contrasts or memory indices like associative and semantic d’) and 
dependent variables (i.e., normalized EEG activity) by a small number of uncorrelated variables known as latent 
vectors. This approach was employed to evaluate: i) differences in EEG oscillations with respect to the baseline 
period, ii) differences in EEG oscillations between HO and aMCI, ii) differences in EEG oscillations between 
aMCI-s and aMCI-c, and iv) the relationship between behavioral data in the memory task and EEG oscillations. 
The whole statistical procedure is explained in detail in Supplementary Material 2.
Cortical EEG sources were only estimated in those spectro-temporal windows showing significant group 
differences (HO vs. aMCI or aMCI-s vs. aMCI-c) and/or significant increases/decreases of normalized power 
with respect to the baseline period. To this aim, we applied a beamforming approach with multiple constraints 
adapted to each individual data (see Supplementary Material 3). Further details related to the statistical approach 
employed at the source level are described in Supplementary Material 4.
Regression analysis to predict conversion from aMCI to AD. Regression analysis included only MRI volumes and/
or EEG measures, either showing significant differences between aMCI-s and aMCI-c, or significant correlations 
with performance that distinguished the aMCI groups.
For the EEG measures, we first created spheres with a radius of 3 voxels, the largest radius that allowed us to 
avoid inclusion of non-significant values in the sphere while maintaining the voxel showing the local maxima as 
center of mass after either comparing the two groups or after correlation with performance for alpha and beta 
power during both the encoding and memory task. Next, results of voxels comprising each sphere were averaged. 
And finally, we averaged results from different spheres belonging to the same functional area (e.g., left posterior 
cingulate cortex).
For each frequency band (i.e., alpha and beta) and task (i.e., encoding and memory), separate forward step wise logistic regression analyses, based on the likelihood ratio, were first conducted for clustered regional EEG 
measures derived from different contrasts. The same analysis was applied for the total volume of the hippocampus 
and amygdala, including the ICV as nuisance variable.
All models were cross-validated with a “leave-10-out” approach, by using 90% of the sample as the training set, 
and the remaining 10% as the validation set. To reduce variability, multiple rounds (N= 34) of cross-validation 
were performed, and the validation results were averaged over the rounds. The main outcome measure was the 
averaged area under the curve (AUC) from the receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve with their corre sponding confidence intervals. Additionally, we computed averaged overall accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity 
based on the cutoff value maximized with the Youden index (sensitivity+specificity ? 1). The statistical signifi cance of validation results was assessed with permutation testing (N=10,000).
Every MRI volume that survived the previous analysis was included in an independent logistic regression 
analysis with each one of the EEG variables whose predictive value was above the 95th percentile of the permu tation distribution. In these particular cases, the ICV was also included as nuisance variable. All these models 
were also subjected to cross-validation and permutation testing. Finally, to determine which of these MRI, EEG, 
and MRI+EEG statistical models were better in predicting conversion to AD, we applied the Friedman test and 
the Wilcoxon signed-rank test with Bonferroni correction on the AUC and accuracy scores derived from the 
cross-validated models. For those models including more than one predictor variable, we determined the relative 
contribution of each predictor by applying the relative weight analysis, and calculated bootstrapped confidence 
intervals with the bias corrected accelerated method to assess whether the contribution of each predictor was 
significantly greater than zero.","Results at the sensor level are described in detail in Supplementary Material 5. Briefly, 
HO showed a significant decrease of beta power (i.e., higher beta ERD) compared with aMCI during both the 
encoding (14–25Hz; 0–1000ms; p<0.04) and retrieval task (13.5–18Hz; 700–1000ms; p<0.05). During mem ory recognition, aMCI-s further showed higher alpha ERD than aMCI-c (see Figs S1 and S2, respectively, in 
Supplementary Material 5).
The EEG sources responsible for these differences were estimated for 8.5Hz within 500 and 1000ms during 
both the encoding and retrieval phases, for 15.75Hz between 400 and 900ms during encoding, and for 16.25Hz 
between 500 and 1000ms during retrieval;; During encoding, aMCI-c showed decreased alpha ERD with respect to aMCI-s (pcluster< 0.02) on a wide spread cortical network comprising medial aspects of bilateral frontal and parietal lobes as well as regions in the 
left lateral and medial regions of the temporal lobe (Fig. 2A and Table 2). The aMCI-c group also showed lower 
alpha ERD (pcluster< 0.03) as compared with the aMCI-s group in most of the regions mentioned above during the 
memory task. These differences further extended to posterior lateral regions of the right hemisphere. Posterior 
cortical regions of the alpha network that distinguished aMCI-s from aMCI-c during both encoding and retrieval 
were correlated with associative d’ only in the aMCI-s group (see Table S5 in Supplementary material 7). This find ing is illustrated in the scatter plots depicted in Fig. 2B for encoding and retrieval, for both aMCI-s and aMCI-c 
individuals. Note that alpha power in the left posterior cingulate cortex during encoding showed the strongest 
contribution to regression in the aMCI-s group (R2=0.48; p=0.001).
While encoding associative memories, the aMCI-c group further showed decreased beta ERD (pcluster<0.006) 
with respect to the aMCI-s group over the anterior cingulate bilaterally, left inferior parietal lobe, and some lateral 
regions of the right frontal lobe. However, these differences were restricted to the right parahippocampal gyrus 
during retrieval (Table 3). Unlike alpha oscillations across cortical networks, beta activity in these brain regions 
was unrelated to memory performance"," Particularly,

In addition, patients underwent diagnostic neuroimag ing procedures [magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)] and
laboratory testing to rule out other causes of cognitive
impairment. MCI was defined as the presence of object ive impairment in memory or other cognitive domains
(performance lower than the fifth percentile on neuro psychological tests as detailed below) in the absence of
functional impairment. History or neurological signs of
major stroke, history of depression (from mild to moderate

and cognitive features of the subjects in this study are

Concerning the neuroimaging analysis, the Qdec inter face in Freesurfer software was used. A vertex-by-vertex

to analyze whether any difference in mean cortical thick ness existed between groups (low: a3/a2 < 1 ?V2
; middle:
1 < a3/a2 < 1.16 ?V2

Middle, and Middle vs. Low. Age, sex, education, global
cognitive level (MMSE score), and WMHs were intro duced as covariates in the analysis to avoid confounding
factors. We first tried to apply an appropriate Bonferroni
multiple-comparison correction in our analysis (at p < 0.05
corrected). Unfortunately, no p-value survived after this
correction. Thus, we choose to set a more restrictive sig nificance threshold (than p < 0.05 corrected) at p < 0.001
uncorrected for multiple comparisons. Moreover, we
considered as significant only the clusters that also
were equal to or larger than 30 mm2

map was generated to display the results on an average
brain. For illustrative purposes, significance was set to a
P-value of ?0.01 uncorrected for multiple comparisons.
As a control analysis, in order to exclude casual rela tionships between EEG markers and cortical volumes, a
correlation between brain areas and memory performance
was examined. The correlation analysis was performed
on the three samples separately (High a3/a2, Low a3/a2,
Middle a3/a2) and the entire sample (High, Low, and
Middle grouped together). An exploratory analysis of
non-linear correlation did not fit into the purpose of
testing our a priori hypothesis. Indeed, we choose to apply
a measure of linear dependence led by our a priori hy potheses for which the MCI group with the greater
cortical thinning and higher a3/a2 EEG level (indicating an
incipient AD) should show a clear correlation with the
memory tests performance, in the sense that an increase in
cortical thinning corresponds to a decrease in memory per formance, and vice versa. Indeed, even if in the cognitive
tests scores there are no significant differences, we hypothe sized that the MCI group with the greater cortical thinning
and higher a3/a2 EEG level, indicating an incipient AD,
should show a clear correlation with the memory tests per formance. The correlation analysis on a vertex-by-vertex
basis was performed specifically for the following neuro psychological memory test results: Babcock Test, Rey audi tory verbal learning test (AVLT) immediate recall, and
Rey AVLT delayed recall. The analysis was thresholded
at p < 0.001 uncorrected for multiple comparisons while
results were mapped at P-value of <0.005 uncorrected
for illustrative purposes. Only the clusters that survived
at the statistical threshold and were equal to or larger
than 15 mm2 were considered as significant.

Preliminarily, one-way ANOVAs were performed in order
to verify that the alpha3/alpha2 relative power ratio was

Finally, a discriminant factor analysis was performed to

higher alpha3/alpha2 ratio has a greater global cortical
atrophy than the other subgroups, thus confirming a
large body of literature [25–31]. Furthermore, the greater
atrophy is significant in two specific brain areas: the precu neus and the supramarginal gyrus (a brain area belonging
to the inferior parietal lobule), on both the left and right
hemispheres.; In patients at low risk to develop AD, a significant
Pearson’s r negative correlation was found between
perfusion in the hippocampal complex ROI and theta
rhythm (r = ?0.544, p = 0.044).;;;; In the higher alpha3/alpha2 frequency power ratio group, greater memory impairment was correlated
with greater cortical atrophy and lower perfusional rate in the temporo-parietal cortex. After a follow-up of three
years, these patients converted in AD.
In patients at high risk to develop AD, other correla tions were found. In contrast to patients at low risk, we
found a positive correlation between perfusion in the
hippocampal complex ROI and theta rhythm (r = 0.729,
p = 0.005) in high risk patients while temporal ROI cor related positively with theta/gamma ratio rhythms (r =
0.736, p = 0.004) in this group",18/74 (AD Converters);; 14/74( non-AD dementia Converters),EEG,"MRI, SPECT","alpha3, alpha2",alpha3/alpha2 power ratio,3 years,"A correct classification of

Vigilance was continuously monitored to avoid drowsiness.
A digital FFT-based power spectrum analysis (Welch technique, Hanning windowing function, no phase shift) was used to compute the power density of EEG rhythms (ranging from 2 to 45 Hz) with a 0.5 Hz frequency resolution.
Two anchor frequencies (the theta/alpha transition frequency (TF) and the individual alpha frequency (IAF) peak) were selected according to the literature guidelines and computed for each subject.
The TF marks the transition frequency between the theta and alpha bands and represents an estimate of the frequency at which the theta and alpha spectra intersect. TF was computed as the minimum power in the alpha frequency range.
The IAF represents the frequency with the maximum power peak within the extended alpha range (5–14 Hz).
Based on TF and IAF, the frequency band range for each subject was estimated, including delta, theta, low alpha, and high alpha bands.
The alpha1 and alpha2 bands were computed for each subject as follows: alpha1 from TF to the midpoint of the TF-IAF range, and alpha2 from this midpoint to the IAF peak.
The mean frequency range computed in MCI subjects considered as a whole are: delta 2.9–4.9 Hz; theta 4.9–6.9 Hz; alpha1 6.9–8.9 Hz; alpha2 8.9–10.9 Hz; alpha3 10.9–12.9 Hz.
Finally, in the frequency bands determined on an individual basis, the relative power spectra for each subject were computed as the ratio between the absolute power and the mean power spectra from 2 to 45 Hz.
The alpha3/alpha2 was computed in all subjects, and three groups were obtained according to increasing tertile values of alpha3/alpha2: low (a3/a2 < 1), middle (1 < a3/a2 < 1.16), and high (a3/a2 > 1.17).",,,V

and lower perfusion in the temporoparietal brain area. The increase in EEG upper/low alpha

dementia and this may be quality information in connection with clinical assessment. ;;;; High versus low: when contrasted with subjects with 
low a3/a2, patients with high a3/a2 power ratio show 
diminishing in the respective superiotemporal, supra marginal, and precuneus cortices, in the right inferior 
parietal cortex, and in the insular cortex. The total volume 
of the CGM lessening in the high a3/a2 group contrasted

the districts of decay were situated in the left supramar ginal gyrus, left precuneus, and postcentral cortex. The 
aggregate CGM diminishment in the high a3/a2 group

contrasts were found between middle and low a3/a2 
power ratio groups.;;The relationship between an EEG marker (the a3/a2 power 
ratio) and the cortical thickness in subjects with MCI was 
looked in the present study. The a3/a2 ratio was picked in 
light of the fact that past work has demonstrated that MCI 
subjects with higher a3/a2 extent are at noteworthy threat 
to make AD.31–34 Our results show that the MCI pack with 
higher a3/a2 extent has a more vital overall cortical rot 
than interchange subgroups, along these lines attesting past 
writing.18,31 Additionally, the more unmistakable rot is basic 
in two specific cerebrum domains: the precuneus and the 
supramarginal gyrus (a brain district having a spot inside 
the parietal lobule), in both left and right hemispheres. These 
results were for the most part expected considering past 
studies. Most likely, useful and auxiliary adjustments of the 
precuneus were seen in MCI,73–75 and likewise in AD,76–78 so 
that the rot of the precuneus has been seen as a pathogno monic marker prodromal AD. Later studies recommend that 
specific territories, particularly the precuneus and posterior 
cingulate together with medial temporal lobe, are exposed 
to amyloid load in AD pathology;;Our outcomes affirm the results of past studies that have 
demonstrated that patients with high risk of conversion to 
AD have diminished SPECT perfusion in the temporoparietal 
cortex and parietal lobule.77,78 Moreover, our results certify 
a definitely comprehended association with hippocampal 
decay.77 The present study exhibits an association between 
cerebral perfusion and theta rhythm. Neverthless, the con nection rises just when considering the distinctive groups 
exclusively utilizing the a3/a2 EEG power ratio. This is 
affirmed by the finding that when the groups are combined, 
no relationship could be found. This is the principle part 
of the study and the particular curiosity of the outcomes. 
Low levels of hippocampal theta EEG power is maintained 
in patients at lower risk of AD, who have a steady pat tern toward a higher brain local blood perfusion, while in 
patients at higher risk, with a fundamentally lower cerebral 
blood perfusion, theta frequency power tends to be greater 
in the hippocampus. Theta rhythms are for the most part not 
detected in the remaining EEG recordings.
Nonetheless, a theta force increment is seen over the 
frontal and transient ranges amid learning and memory 
undertakings. The theta rhythms that are recorded amid these 
undertakings are thought to be created by the initiation of 
the septal–hippocampal framework. The hippocampus has a 
cholinergic innervation beginning from the basal forebrain, 
the medial septum, and the vertical limb of the diagonal band 
of Broca. The synchronized depolarization of hippocampal 
neurons produces field potentials that have a primary recur rence of 3–12 Hz and are generally known as hippocampal 
theta rhythm.69,70 A cholinergic–glutamatergic specula tion of AD, in which most indications may be clarified by 
cholinergic–glutamatergic deficiencies, has been progressed. 
Neuronal damage may incorporate an excitotoxic part that 
perhaps adds to the early cholinergic deficiency. This exci totoxic segment may happen, at any rate to a limited extent, 
at the septal level where the somas of cholinergic neurons 
are found. This affront may alter septal systems and add to 
the irregular information processing in AD brain, including 
its hyperexcitability states",18/74 (AD Converters);; 14/74( non-AD dementia Converters),EEG,"MRI, SPECT","alpha3, alpha2",alpha3/alpha2 power ratio,3 years,88.30%,19,frequency,"Recording EEG data from 19 scalp locations using electrodes placed in an elastic cap.

Simon-Shlomo Poil etal. 2013,MCI = 86,MCI-S = 67 (65-71); MCI-C = 69 (67-72),"Upon the first visit at the Alzheimer Center, all subjects under went a thorough 1-day examination consisting of history taking,
physical, and neurological assessment, neuropsychological testing
including the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) (Folstein
et al., 1975), laboratory tests, structural magnetic resonance imag ing (MRI), and a routine electroencephalogram (EEG). After
reviewing the clinical and ancillary imaging data, a multidisci plinary team established a consensus-based final diagnosis for
each patient. The initial diagnosis of MCI was based on the cri teria set by (Petersen et al., 1999), consisting of (a) objective
memory impairment as seen during neuropsychological evalua tion, defined by performances ? 1.5 standard deviation below the
mean value of education—and that of age matched controls, (b)

As an alternative to genetic optimization of biomarkers included
in the logistic regression, we employed an elastic net logistic
regression algorithm (Zou and Hastie, 2005) as implemented in
the GLMnet package for Matlab (http://www-stat.stanford.edu/
~tibs/glmnet-matlab/) (Friedman et al., 2010). This algorithm
promises a build-in selection of features that optimally can per form much better than the less stable genetic optimization. The
elastic net optimizes the number of biomarkers included in the
diagnostic index by minimizing both the L1 and L2 norm of the
regression coefficients by minimizing the equation
L (?1, ?2, ?) = |z ? X?|
2 + ?1 |?| + ?2 |?|
2
where the first term is similar to the logistic regression, and the
second and third are the penalizing terms (the elastic net) (Zou
and Hastie, 2005). The parameters ?1 and ?2 determines the
influence of either the L1 or L2 norm penalty. We define a new
combined parameter
? = ?2
?1 + ?2
which we optimized in 5-split cross-validation based on the best
classification by training on second-year data, and testing on the
1/5 left-out subject group on first-year EEG (note that subjects
which did not have a second-year EEG were not included, and,
therefore, serve as our ultimate test group (see Results) (data not
shown). We found the best classification with ? = 0.8.
STATISTICS: CLASSIFICATION OUTCOME EVALUATION
To evaluate the outcome of our classification we use five different
measures:
• Sensitivity (SE): defined as the (number of correctly classified
AD-converter patients)/(number of AD-converter patients).
• Specificity (SP): defined as the (number of correctly classified
MCI-stable subjects)/(number of MCI-stable subjects).
• Positive predictive value (PPV): defined as (number of cor rectly classified AD-converter patients)/(number of patients
classified as AD-converters).
• Positive likelihood ratio (PLR): defined as (Sensitivity)/
(1-Specificity).
• Matthew correlation coefficient (MCC): explains the correla tion between the outcome and the expected outcome (Baldi
et al., 2000).
A Matthew correlation coefficient higher than 0.20, sensitivity
higher than 65%, specificity higher than 65%, positive predictive
value higher than 65%, and a positive likelihood ratio higher than
1.6 means that the classification is significantly different from a
random classification (Monte Carlo simulation, 5000 iterations,
n = 65, note these results depends on the sample size making the
threshold levels lower for larger sample sizes, p < 0.05). Perfect
classification would give a Matthew correlation coefficient (MCC)
of 1, sensitivity of 100%, specificity of 100%, positive predictive
value of 100%, and an infinite positive likelihood ratio.
An issue with these outcome measures is that they only tell
how well the classification fits the given subgroup of subjects,
but not how well the classification generalizes to other subject
populations. We counteract this by three approaches; (1) classi fication was performed on the second EEG recording, whereas
the prediction was tested on the first EEG recording, (2) as the
ultimate test we evaluated the prediction on subjects not included
for classifier training (because not all subjects had a second EEG
recording), and (3) we performed a half-split cross-validation. In
the half-split cross-validation the sample was divided randomly
in half several times (1000 iterations); the classifier was then
trained on the first half, and the outcome was evaluated on the
second half. We report the median outcome measures over these
splits. Cross-validation gives an estimate of the classification
performance on an “unknown” sample (Witten et al., 2011).
However, cross-validation also suffers from lower n numbers,
which means their outcome should be viewed as a conservative
estimate of the average outcome.
STATISTICS: GROUP DIFFERENCES AND CORRELATIONS
We use non-parametric permutation tests based on median
(Box and Andersen, 1955; Ernst, 2004) to test for differences
between groups. Non-parametric tests are more robust toward
non-normal data, but also often have lower power than paramet ric such as student’st-test. Confidence intervals (95%) were found
using non-parametric bias corrected and accelerated bootstrap
(n = 5000) (DiCiccio and Efron, 1996).

et al., 2006; Rubin et al., 1989; Zaudig, 1992]. Summarizing,
the inclusion criteria were as follows: (i) objective memory
impairment on neuropsychological evaluation, as defined
by performances  1.5 standard deviation below the mean
value of age- and education-matched controls for a battery
of neuropsychological tests to assess cognitive perform ance in the domains of memory (see in the following para graph), language, executive function/attention, and visuo construction; (ii) normal activities of daily living as docu mented by the history and evidence of independent living;
and (iii) Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) Score of 0.5. The
exclusion criteria included (i) mild AD, as diagnosed by
standard protocols including NINCDS–ADRDA [McKhann
et al., 1984] and DSM-IV; (ii) evidence [including magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) procedures] of concomitant cerebral impairment such as frontotemporal degeneration,
cerebrovascular disease, and reversible cognitive impair ment (including pseudo-depressive dementia); (iii) marked
fluctuations in cognitive performance compatible with
Lewy body dementia and/or features of mixed cognitive
impairment including cerebrovascular disease (particular
attention was devoted to this point given the working hy pothesis focused on cognitive stability in MCI subjects);
(iv) evidence of concomitant extra-pyramidal symptoms;
(v) clinical and indirect evidence of depression as revealed
by the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS; [Yesavage et al.,
1982–1983] scores lower than 14 (no depression); (vi) other
psychiatric diseases, epilepsy, drug addiction, alcohol de pendence (as revealed by a psychiatric interview), and use
of psychoactive drugs including acetylcholinesterase inhib itors or other drugs enhancing brain cognitive functions;
and (vii) current or previous uncontrolled or complicated
systemic diseases (including diabetes mellitus) or trau matic brain injuries. Of note, the routine clinical protocol
did not include the assessment of possible vitamin/min eral deficiencies in the recruited MCI subjects. All subjects
explained the importance of a wealth life style and sleep awake cycle. They were also informed about the impor tance of vitamins and minerals in the diet and invited to
ensure a regular and abundant daily intake of mixed vege tables and fresh fruits.
A battery of neuropsychological tests was performed to
assess cognitive performance in the domains of memory,
language, executive function/attention, and visuo-con struction abilities. The tests to assess memory were the im mediate and delayed recall measure of the Rey Auditory
Verbal Learning Test [Carlesimo, 1996; Rey, 1958], the
delayed recall of Rey figure [Rey, 1968], the delayed recall
of a three-word list [Chandler et al., 2004], the delayed
recall of a story [Spinnler and Tognoni, 1987], and/or
Busckhe–Fuld. The tests to assess language were the 1-min
verbal fluency for letters [Novelli, 1986], the 1-min verbal
fluency for fruits, animals or car trades [Novelli, 1986],
and the Token test [De Renzi and Vignolo, 1962; Spinnler
and Tognoni, 1987]. The tests to assess executive function
and attention were the Trail Making Test part A and B
[Reitan, 1958], the attentive matrices [Spinnler and Tog noni, 1987], and the Digit forward and the Digit backward
[Orsini et al., 1987]. Finally, the tests to assess visuo-con struction were the copy of Rey figures [Rey, 1968], the
Raven of Progressive matrices [Raven, 1965], and/or the
Clock Drawing test [Shulman et al., 1993].
In the MCI subjects, MMSE score was obtained at the
date of the EEG recordings (baseline I MMSE) and approx imately after 1 year (follow-up II MMSE). Based on the
percentage difference of the MMSE score between baseline
and 1-year follow-up (MMSEvar), the MCI subjects were
divided into three subgroups of 19 patients: the
DECREASED group with MMSEvar   about  4% (i.e.,
subjects loosing equal or more than 4% of the MMSEvar;
N ¼ 43), the INCREASED group with MMSEvar   about
þ4% (i.e., subjects gaining equal or more than 4% of the MMSEvar; N ¼ 30), and the STABLE group with MMSE var between  4% and þ4% (N ¼ 27). We used the MMSE
score rather than the memory score for the subjects’ classi fication, because the former is typically used for the
screening of global cognition in follow-up studies on MCI
and AD subjects. At this early stage of the research, the
MMSE threshold for the classification was arbitrarily cho sen to divide the present MCI population into three
groups of MCI with comparable age, gender, and educa tion. We are aware that the three groups might not include
amnesic MCI subjects intrinsically different from each
other at the border of the categories and that these limits
did not correspond to any neurophysiological or neuro pathological entity. They have just a heuristic value at this
early stage of the research. With the MMSEvar limits at
 4%, MCI subjects who ‘‘substantially’’ change follow-up
MMSE score are supposed to be much more represented
in the DECREASED and INCREASED groups than in the
STABLE group. Noteworthy, it has been reported that the
test–retest reliability of the MMSE score is supposed to
range from about 0.80–0.95 as test–retest correlation [Tom baugh and McIntyre, 1992]. Furthermore, it has been sug gested that the use of a short-term follow-up of few days
would help the estimation of the MMSE reliability
([Becker, 2001; Becker and Markwell 2000] for details on
the MMSE reliability problem). Unfortunately, the general
design of this study did not allow it. The data collection
closely followed the routine clinical practice in each centre,
because we received research funds just to support for
coordination and pooling data of clinical practice.
Probable AD was diagnosed according to NINCDS–
ADRDA [McKhann et al., 1984] and DSM IV criteria. The
recruited AD patients underwent general medical, neuro logical, and psychiatric assessments. Patients were also
rated with a number of standardized diagnostic and sever ity instruments that included mini-mental state evaluation
(MMSE; [Folstein et al., 1975], CDR Scale ([Hughes et al.,
1982], GDS [Yesavage et al., 1982], Hachinski Ischemic
Score (HIS; [Rosen et al., 1980], and Instrumental Activities
of Daily Living scale (IADL; [Lawton and Brodie, 1969]).
Neuroimaging diagnostic procedures (MRI) and complete
laboratory analyses were carried out to exclude other
causes of progressive or reversible dementias to have a
clinically homogenous mild AD group. Exclusion criteria
included any evidence of (i) frontotemporal dementia,
diagnosed according to current criteria [Knopman et al.,
2005], (ii) vascular dementia, diagnosed according to
NINDS–AIREN criteria [Roman et al., 1993], (iii) extra pyramidal syndromes, (iv) reversible dementias (includ ing depressive pseudodementia), and (v) Lewy body
dementia, according to the criteria by McKeith [2005].
The Nold subjects were recruited mostly among noncon sanguineous patients’ relatives. All Nold subjects under went physical and neurological examinations as well as
cognitive screening (including MMSE and GDS). Subjects
affected by chronic systemic illnesses, those receiving
psychoactive drugs, or with a history of neurological or psychiatric disease were excluded. All Nold subjects have
a GDS score lower than 14 (no depression).

hypothesis that regional EEG sources as revealed by the
LORETA solutions had amplitude sensitive to the cogni tive status of the amnesic MCI subjects when compared
with the control groups formed by the Nold and mild AD
subjects. The confirmation of this hypothesis would vali date the procedures relative to subjects’ recruitment and
EEG data analysis. To this aim, the LORETA solutions
from the Nold, amnesic MCI, and mild AD subjects were
used as an input for an ANOVA. Subjects’ age, education,
gender, IAF peak, and MMSE were used as covariates.
Mauchly’s test evaluated the sphericity assumption. Cor rection of the degrees of freedom was made with the
Greenhouse–Geisser procedure. Duncan test was used for
post hoc comparisons (P < 0.05). The ANOVA analysis
used the factors Group (Nold, MCI, mild AD; independent
variable), Band (delta, theta, alpha 1, alpha 2, beta 1, and
beta 2), and ROI (central, frontal, parietal, occipital, tempo ral, and limbic). The control hypothesis would be con firmed by the following two statistical results: (i) a statistical ANOVA effect including the factor Group (P <
0.05); (ii) a post hoc test indicating statistically significant
differences of the LORETA solutions with the patterns Nold < MCI < mild AD or Nold > MCI > mild AD (Dun can test, P < 0.05).
A second statistical session aimed at evaluating the work ing hypothesis that cortical sources of alpha rhythms were
higher in amplitude in the STABLE than DECREASED
group; this statistical analysis also aimed at evaluating if
these cortical sources differed in the MCI groups when
compared with the Nold and the AD groups. The ANOVA
used the factors Group (STABLE, DECREASED,
INCREASED, Nold, and AD; independent variable), Band
(delta, theta, alpha 1, alpha 2, beta 1, and beta 2), and ROI
(central, frontal, parietal, occipital, temporal, and limbic).
Subjects’ age, education, gender, IAF peak, and I MMSE
were used as covariates. In addition, we took into account
the individual MMSEvar and the ‘‘regression’’ of the follow up MMSE score toward the MMSE group mean. For a
given subject, such ‘‘regression’’ was defined by two varia bles: (i) the group mean of the baseline MMSE score minus
the individual value of the baseline MMSE score; and (ii)
the group mean of the baseline MMSE score minus the indiidual value of the follow-up MMSE score. Practically, we
included the individual MMSEvar and the two ‘‘regression’’
values as three additional covariates into the main ANOVA.
Of note, a previous reference study [Tombaugh, 2005] has
shown a regression to the group mean of the MMSE score
across test repetitions in Nold subjects, Namely, higher
MMSE values at the first examination tend to be lower at
the second examination, whereas the lower values at the
first examination tend to be higher at the second one.","baseline posterior cortical
sources of alpha rhythms (Amplitude) = STABLE > DECREASED, INCREASED",,,"Based on the MMSE percentage difference between
baseline and 1-year follow-up (MMSEvar), the amnesic
MCI subjects were retrospectively divided into the
DECREASED (MMSEvar    4%), STABLE (MMSEvar  
0), and INCREASED (MMSEvar   þ4%) groups. Among
others, three covariates were of special interest, namely
the individual MMSEvar and two variables for the indi vidual regression of the follow-up MMSE score to the
MMSE group mean. Furthermore, we performed two con trol ANOVAs using even more stringent MMSEvar limits
(i.e.,  1.5% and 0% for the STABLE group;  12% for the
INCREASED and DECREASED groups), in line with a ref erence study [Tombaugh, 2005]. As an original finding, all
statistical analyses showed that baseline posterior cortical
sources of alpha rhythms (8–10.5 Hz) were higher in am plitude in the STABLE than in the DECREASED and
INCREASED groups. Furthermore, there were less amne sic MCI subjects converted to AD (1-year follow-up) in the
STABLE (N ¼ 4) and INCREASED (N ¼ 5) groups than in
the DECREASED (N ¼ 17), with a global annual conver sion rate to AD of about 26% in line with previous evi dence showing an annual conversion rate comprised
between 6 and 40% [Petersen et al., 2001; Jack et al., 2005].
Of note, the five amnesic MCI subjects of the INCREASED
group who converted to AD had a quite low-mean MMSE
score at baseline (22.9   1 SE) and remained close to a
MMSE score of 25 (25.2   0.6 SE) at 1-year follow-up. In
the whole, the present findings indicate that, at group
level, the amnesic MCI subjects who remained cognitively
stable at 1-year follow-up were characterized by cortical
sources of resting alpha rhythms with relatively high

c. Spatial Domain: LORETA (Low Resolution Electromagnetic Tomography) software was used to estimate cortical sources of EEG rhythms. This technique models 3D distributions of EEG sources within a three-shell spherical head model, including scalp, skull, and brain compartments.

The analysis involves both temporal (through the use of consecutive 2-s epochs) and frequency domains (through FFT-based power spectrum analysis). Additionally, the spatial domain is considered when estimating cortical sources of EEG rhythms using LORETA.","EEG data were recorded from 19 electrodes placed on the scalp according to the international 10-20 system.

history of non-demented persons with apparently primary
cognitive deficits, i.e., deficits not due to psychic (anxiety,
depression, etc.) or physical (hypothyroidism, vit. B12 and
folate deficiency, uncontrolled heart disease, uncontrolled
diabetes, etc.) conditions. Patients were rated with a series of standardized diagnostic and severity instruments, including
the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE; Folstein et al.,
1975), the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale (CDRS; Hughes
et al., 1982), the Hachinski Ischemic Scale (HIS; Rosen et
al., 1980) and the instrumental and basic activities of daily
living (IADL, BADL, Lawton and Brodie, 1969). In addi tion, patients underwent diagnostic neuroimaging procedures
(magnetic resonance imaging, MRI), and laboratory testing
to rule out other causes of cognitive impairment. These inclu sion and exclusion criteria for MCI were based on previous
seminal studies (Petersen et al., 1995, 1997, 2001; Portet et
al., 2006; Geroldi et al., 2006; Dubois et al., 2007). Inclusion
criteria of the study were all of the following: (i) complaint by
the patient, or report by a relative or the general practitioner,
of memory or other cognitive disturbances; (ii) Mini-Mental
State Examination score of 24–27/30, or MMSE of 28 and
higher plus low performance (score of 2–6 or higher) on
the clock drawing test (Lezak et al., 2004); (iii) sparing
of instrumental and basic activities of daily living or func tional impairment steadily due to causes other than cognitive
impairment, such as physical impairments, sensory loss, gait
or balance disturbances, etc. Exclusion criteria were any one
of the following: (i) patients aged 90 years and older; (ii) his tory of depression or juvenile-onset psychosis; (iii) history
or neurological signs of major stroke; (iv) other psychiatric

use of psychoactive drugs, including acetylcholinesterase
inhibitors or other drugs enhancing brain cognitive functions;

brain injuries. All patients underwent: (i) semi-structured
interview with the patient and – whenever possible – with
another informant (usually, the patient’s spouse or a child
of the patient) by a geriatrician or neurologist; (ii) physi cal and neurological examinations; (iii) performance-based
tests of physical function, gait and balance; (iv) neuropsy chological battery assessing memory (Babcock Story Recall

more extensive battery would have been helpful in detecting
early and more subtle deficits. Anyway, it should be consid ered that a larger battery is more time consuming and could
bias the global level of attention in subjects with cognitive
impairment. On the whole, we feel that the NPS battery was
reliable to detect the threshold of conversion in dementia.
Three groups of patients were obtained according to clin ical outcome after 3 years of follow-up: (1) MCI who did
not convert to any dementia; (2) MCI who converted in
AD; (3) MCI who converted to dementia other than AD
(fronto-temporal spectrum, FTD, vascular dementia, VD, or
Lewy body dementia, LBD). The diagnosis of AD was made
according to NINCDS–ADRDA criteria (McKhann et al.,
1984) and the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental
Disorders IV (DSM-IV; APA, 1994), the diagnosis of FTD
was made according the Lund–Manchester criteria (Lund and

as statistical tool. All scores and results are referred to the
diagnosis moment. At first, any significant differences among
groups in demographic and morphostructural variables, i.e.,

evaluated. Greenhouse-Geisser correction and Mauchley’s
sphericity test were applied to all ANOVAs. In order to avoid
a confounding effect, ANOVAs were carried out using age ducation, MMSE score as covariates. Duncan’s test was
used for post hoc comparisons. For all statistical tests the
significance level was set at p < 0.05.
Preliminarily, one-way ANOVAs were performed in order
to verify that theta/gamma and alpha3/alpha2 relative power
ratio were significantly different among groups.
Subsequently, one-way ANOVAs were performed with the
aim to find difference in the NPS scores between groups.
Finally, a discriminant factor analysis was performed to
verify if the same significant variables could be useful in
discriminating subjects and could have a diagnostic value.

Electrode Placement: EEG activity was recorded from 19 sites using electrodes set in an elastic cap and positioned according to the 10–20 International system.

Reference: The left and right mastoids served as linked-mastoid reference for all electrodes.

Band-pass Filtering: The data were recorded with a band-pass filter of 0.3–70 Hz to remove unwanted frequency components outside this range.

Sampling Rate: The data were digitized at a sampling rate of 250 Hz.

Impedance Check: Electrodes-skin impedance was set below 5 k? to ensure good contact between the electrodes and the scalp.

Ocular and Muscular Artifact Rejection: An automatic procedure was used to identify and discard EEG epochs with ocular, muscular, and other types of artifacts. A threshold of ±50 ?V was set to detect muscular artifacts, and two expert electroencephalographists manually double-checked and confirmed the automatic selections.

Epoching: The continuous EEG data were fragmented offline into consecutive epochs of 2 seconds.

Frequency Range Estimation: The frequency range of interest for each subject was estimated based on the individually detected spectral peak of the main EEG frequencies. This estimation was used to define delta, theta, low alpha, high alpha, beta1, beta2, and gamma frequency bands for each subject.

Power Spectrum Analysis: A digital Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)-based power spectrum analysis using the Welch technique and Hanning windowing function was performed to compute the power density of EEG rhythms with a 0.5 Hz frequency resolution within the defined frequency bands.

Artifact-Free Epochs: Only artifact-free epochs were included in the analysis. The number of artifact-free epochs did not significantly differ among the subject groups.

Relative Power Calculation: The relative power density for each frequency band was computed as the ratio between the absolute power and the mean power spectra from 2 to 45 Hz. The relative band power at each band was defined as the mean of the relative band power for each frequency bin within that band.
Ratio Calculation: The theta/gamma and alpha3/alpha2 relative power ratios were computed and analyzed.",,,V

mild to moderate disease rated according to global deterioration
scale (GDS), stages 4–5 (Reisberg et al., 1982). All the patients were
living in their homes. When the AD patients were evaluated, all
had undergone single photon emission computed tomography
(SPECT) and morphologic radiology (CT/MRI). The diagnosis of
MCI, using F06,7 according to ICD-10, was based on a history of
cognitive decline, verified by a relative, without reaching the level
of dementia. Clinically, these patients were in GDS stages 2–3. Par ticipants in the control group had to have no history of cognitive
decline and a mini-mental state exam (MMSE) (Folstein et al.,
1975) score of at least 26 points out of 30. The MMSE has been
translated into Icelandic and validated (Tómasson, 1986), however
a revised version was used (Snædal et al., 1997). The characteristics
of the participants are shown in Table 1.
To minimize variability, all the AD patients were treated with
the same acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, galantamine (Reminyl ).
One MCI patient receiving rivastigmine (Exelon ) did not use it
for 2 weeks prior to EEG recording. One control receiving chlordi azepoxide and clidinium (Librax ) did not use it for 5 days prior

Feature Extraction: The researchers extracted a series of features from EEG data across various frequency bands and calculated various statistical properties, such as power, relative power, spectral entropy, etc., for each of these bands.

10-Fold Cross-Validation: This technique is used to assess the accuracy of a model, in this case, to evaluate the accuracy of AD classification for various EEG feature pairs. Cross-validation involves dividing the data into ""folds"" (10, in this case), training the model on a subset of these folds, and then testing the model on the remaining data. This is repeated until each fold has been used for testing, and the accuracy scores across these iterations are averaged to give a more robust measure of model performance.

Signal Processing and Relative Power Analysis (SPR): This is used to generate two principal components that best separate the AD and control groups.","Theta Frequency Power: This was higher in AD patients compared to controls. The researchers saw this as consistent with a known phenomenon of ""slowing"" in the EEG of AD patients, which is represented by a larger shift of power from the alpha frequency band into the theta frequency band.

Alpha Frequency Power: This was lower in AD patients compared to controls, due to the shift of power into the theta band.",,,"The study concludes that Electroencephalogram (EEG) can be used as a potentially effective tool for diagnosing Alzheimer's Disease (AD). The researchers were able to differentiate clearly between the EEG features of AD patients and control individuals using the first two principal components.

Additionally, the EEG patterns of some patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) were found to be similar to those of AD patients, especially for those who were diagnosed with AD within a year of the EEG recording. This suggests that the method developed in this study could be useful in predicting which MCI patients will develop AD.

However, the researchers noted that the EEG patterns of the MCI group were more heterogeneous overall, suggesting more variability within this group.

The administration of scopolamine, a drug, was found to increase the accuracy of AD diagnosis using EEG measurements. However, they caution that scopolamine should only be used in cases with uncertain EEG outcomes due to its potential undesirable effects on certain patients.

The authors acknowledge some limitations in their study such as strict inclusion and exclusion criteria, and the small sample size. They expressed interest in expanding their research with a larger database of EEG recordings for various dementias and normal controls, to further develop EEG as a diagnostic tool for AD.

comparisons. The normality of data distribution was veri fied with skewness and kurtosis tests. Statistical analysis
was performed to compare EEG measures between groups,
using a two-way repeated measures ANOVA, with task
condition (detection, 2-back) and electrode site (frontal,
central, parietal, occipital) as within-subject factors. The
significance values were determined using the Green house–Geisser correction. Post hoc analysis was performed
using Fisher’s least square difference test (Milliken and
Johnson 1984).
As the time series were not stationary (as assessed with
run tests), we explored the association between the tem poral evolution of gamma oscillations and cognitive
decline using the following procedures. First, phase dia grams were used to explore the best time lag to discrimi nate between PMCI and SMCI. Phase space represents all
the possible states of a dynamic system. A phase plot corresponds to a graph of gamma oscillation values at time
t minus a lag (t - lag) on the y axis versus gamma values
at time t on the x axis. Plots were drawn for each electrode,
task and subject for lag time periods ranging from 1 to
20 ms. Then, linear regression models (Dwyer and Feinleib
1992), taking into account the clustering of measures
within each subject, were built with gamma values as the
dependent variable and group, task, electrode and gamma
values at a given time lag (gammalag) as the independent
variables. Geometrically, the regression coefficient asso ciated with the gammalag parameter corresponds to the
slope of the local regression line of the ellipse in the phase
diagrams. The present analysis of phase space representa tion was performed for each electrode site and is thus quite
different from that of the degree of linear relatedness
between two channels (i.e., the functional coupling of
cerebral areas explored by the non-linear coherence
function).
Fractal dilation was used to estimate the fractal dimen sion (a measure of complexity represented by a unique
value) of the phase diagrams using the Fractal analysis
software (Fractalyse, CNRS, Franche-Comte´ and Bourgo gne University, Version: 2.4; downloadable from Web site:
http://www.fractalyse.org). Then, fractal dimensions were
compared between the two MCI groups for each task and
electrode sites using unpaired Student’s t test. In addition,
univariate and multiple logistic regression models were
built to assess the relationship between cognitive decline in
MCI (binary dependent variable) and the fractal dimension
of the gamma oscillation controlling for task and electrode
site effects (independent variables). This method can also
evaluate the amount of variability of the dependent variable
(cognitive decline) that can be explained by the model and
thus provide an estimate of the strength of their relation ship. Statistical threshold was set at p\0.05. Statistical
analyses were performed using the Stata software package

This is frequency-domain analysis.

Event-related oscillations (EROs) also involve some level of frequency domain analysis as they are band-pass filtered at a specific frequency range (35–45 Hz in this case) before being averaged. However, the averaging process is performed in the time domain.","Ocular Artifact Correction: EEG signals were corrected for ocular artifacts using an offline threshold reduction algorithm. This algorithm operates by subtracting EOG signals from EEG channels using a linear derivation approach with a spatial filter transform.

Movement Artifact Removal: The EEG signals were automatically cleared of movement artifacts in which voltage exceeded 100 µV criteria. The remaining trials were inspected visually to control for minor artifacts.

Epoching: EEG data were detached into epochs of 1,050 ms, starting 525 ms before the stimulus onset.

Selection of Specific Events: To eliminate effects from manual responses and exclude the confounding effect of motor processing, correct answers without motor response were analyzed according to the task condition (detection, 2-back).

Spectral Power Analysis: Artifact-free close and open eyes EEG recordings at rest were converted into the frequency domain using a FFT function computed on overlapping 2-s windows (10% Hanning filter).

Finally, Mutual Information Analysis was used to analyze the EEG in patients with Alzheimer’s Disease [25] and an efficient k-means clustering algorithm was implemented [26].",channels 1-8 relative beta power = MCI-like AD > MCI-like controls,,,"When relative power of the EEG as recorded from MCI 
patients was analyzed using an automated k-means cluster ing algorithm, it was discovered that two clearly identifiable 
subgroups emerged; one with EEG beta power profiles simi lar to AD patients (subgroup 1) and one more similar to con trols (subgroup 2). The biological importance of this EEG 
power differential at various brain locations is not presently 
understood. But, it is intriguing to speculate that such differ ences may nonetheless be effective in distinguishing those 
MCI patients most likely to progress to AD from those less 
likely to do so, and our preliminary results suggest some 
promise for such an approach. It is particularly important to 
note that our predictions concerning the 3 MCI patients who 
were correctly identified as unlikely to progress to AD, and 
the 1 MCI patient who was accurately predicted to develop 
AD, were made without reference to any other diagnostic 
instruments and took place well before any clinical signs or 
behavioral manifestations of AD were actually exhibited in 
the MCI patients. Thus, our preliminary findings suggest that 
automated pattern recognition techniques applied to EEG 
brainwave characteristics, (particularly if supplemented by 
other physiological, genetic and neuropsychological meas ures), holds considerable promise for the early identification 
of those MCI patients most likely to progress to AD. Moreo ver, if our continuing evaluation of this diagnostic technique 
should prove reliable after testing a greater number of fol low-up patients, it would have broad implications for the 
screening of participants in drug trials, and for providing 
guidance to patients and family members regarding their 
expectations for potential AD progression. ;; Of particular interest is the fact that for 6 patients return ing for their two-year clinical follow-up examinations, the k means clustering algorithm accurately predicted the clinical 
status of 4 patients. Specifically, there were 3 MCI patients 
that the algorithm predicted would not have progressed to 
AD, and indeed these individuals did not show any signs of 
AD at clinical follow-up. The algorithm also predicted that 3 
other MCI patients would progress to AD however, only one 
of them had actually done so at follow-up. The later finding 
does not rule out eventual progression to AD in these two 
patients, but rather may be reflective of the disease progress ing at a somewhat slower than anticipated rate.",6/out of 25 which this study predict 4 of them correctly,EEG,,beta,"relative beta power, frequency band power",2 years,> 80%,16," This paper performed EEG analysis in the frequency domain, dividing the EEG signal into respective alpha, beta, delta and theta bandwidths [2].

Furthermore, the study utilized a k-means algorithm to classify MCI patients into two subgroups [3]."," Preprocessing steps of EEG data in this paper included filtering using a 0.5 to 50 hertz bandpass filter, normalizing the EEG data epoch for each channel by dividing it by the total power present in the channel, and applying a set of digital filters to divide the EEG signal into respective alpha, beta, delta and theta bandwidths [2].",," This paper used a k-means clustering algorithm [1] to classify MCI patients into two subgroups, one resembling AD patients and one resembling controls. The algorithm was tested for its ability to segregate individuals into meaningful groups by attempting to categorize AD patients versus controls and was found to have achieved over 80% correct classifications [2]. In the second stage of the study, the same k-means algorithm was used to classify MCI patients into two subgroups [3] based on their EEG characteristics, specifically those who resembled AD patients versus those who did not. The algorithm is an automated mathematical categorization technique and was chosen due to its ability to calculate the centroid (mean EEG power) for each category [4]. Initial cluster centers were chosen at random, however, the algorithm converged quickly [5], so running it several times was not very time consuming.",

were used as covariates. Mauchly’s test evaluated the sphericity

the Greenhouse-Geisser procedure. Duncan test was used for
post hoc comparisons (P 0.05).
The ANOVAs evaluated the working hypothesis, namely the
existence of differences in the EEG source power and/or spectral
coherence between MCI Converted and MCI Stable subjects. The
Nold group was used as a control group. For the evaluation of the
EEG power, the ANOVA used Group (Nold, MCI Stable, MCI
Converted), Band (delta, theta, alpha 1, alpha 2, beta 1, beta 2,
gamma), and regions of interest—ROI—(central, frontal, parietal,
occipital, temporal, limbic) as factors. For the evaluation of the

alpha 1) showed a clear effect on AD conversion, with high
coherence associated with unfavorable outcome. No evi dence of demographic (age and education) and baseline
cognitive status (baseline MMSE) effect was found. How ever, these variables were taken into account in the final
model. The multiple Cox regression indicated that spectral
EEG coherence for both the fastest (gamma) and the slowest (delta) rhythms are heralding the rate of “MCI
conversion to AD.” Independently, an additional effect
could be ascribed to temporal delta power.
The relatively small sample size of the present study,
the need to obtain reliable cutoffs of a validation from
independent samples and, more generally, the “disadvan tages of dichotomizing” (Royston and Sauerbrei, 2005)
pushed us to avoid the recoding of continuous predictors
into categorical variables by grouping values into two or
more categories. However, for a graphical representation
of the predictive ability of EEG, we tentatively dichoto mized our continuous neurophysiological parameters by
means of smoothed ROC curves. This procedure indicated
that the “optimal” cutoff was 2.57 for temporal delta

used:
(a) One-way ANOVAs by outcome group were computed
for each of the neuropsychological variables.
(b) A multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) by out come group was computed for a selected subset of QEEG
features. To facilitate data reduction of the large number
of features extracted from each QEEG analysis prior to
entry to the MANOVA, one-way ANOVAs by group were
computed for each EEG frequency band and F-values
from these ANOVAs were color coded and displayed as
topographic maps. To adjust for the large number of com parisons made, only findings significant at the p < 0.01
level were considered for further analyses. Multivari ate QEEG features best reflecting the bands and regions of ANOVA significances were selected for entry to the
MANOVA analysis. Further, the most highly significant
univariates within each measure set were also entered
into the MANOVA ;;;* A logistic regression procedure (SAS/STAT Proc Logis tic) was used to determine the degree to which a finer
distinction of longitudinal outcome could be predicted from
baseline neurometric QEEG features. That is, Decliners
were divided into two sub-groups: those who declined to
a diagnosis of MCI (Mild Decliners, N= 20, GDS = 3) and
those who converted to dementia, in all cases a diagnosis of

Hence, the study takes into account the spatial domain of the EEG data.

Frequency Domain: The paper also heavily focuses on the frequency domain. After the initial preprocessing, the EEG data is transformed using the FFT method to the frequency domain. The global field power (GFP) is calculated for different frequency bands: delta (1-3.5 Hz), theta (4-7.5 Hz), alpha (8-11.5 Hz), beta 1 (12-15.5 Hz), and beta 2 (16-19.5 Hz).

The EEGs were referred to the linked mastoids and recorded on a computer-based system (Bio-Logic Brain Atlas) in a resting awake condition with the eyes closed. The authors maintained vigilance control by continuously monitoring subjects to detect and avoid changes in alertness such as drowsiness.

Filtering: Before further processing, the EEG data was filtered with a band pass of 1.0-30.0 Hz. This helps to remove frequencies outside this range, reducing noise and artifacts not relevant to the frequencies of interest in the study.

Artifact Removal: The paper mentions that the first 15 successive 2-second samples were selected and edited off-line by visual inspection to exclude artifacts. Artifacts are non-brain activities that can contaminate the EEG data, including muscle movements, eye blinks, or environmental noise. These must be removed for accurate analysis.

FFT Analysis: After artifact removal, frequency analysis was performed using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) dipole approximation method, which enables the transformation of the EEG time-series data into frequency-domain data. This method allows the calculation of the amplitude of single EEG generators and their 3D localization in conventional frequency bands.

Normalization: For further analysis, the global field power (GFP) values, which correspond to the generalized EEG amplitude, were logarithmically transformed to normalize data distribution.",,,

Alpha and theta relative power and mean frequency were identified as significant predictors of clinical deterioration in patients with MCI who progressed to AD.

The study supports the hypothesis that there is a subgroup of patients with MCI who will develop AD, and these patients can be identified by the dynamic changes in their EEG.

From a clinical perspective, these findings are significant because they propose that these EEG parameters could serve as markers for assessing treatment effectiveness at early stages of AD.

Interestingly, the study found that EEG coherence values were similar in patients with MCI who progressed to AD and those who did not. This aligns with previous studies suggesting that EEG coherence might be a trait marker that appears early in the disease course and remains stable over time.

mean field power (GMFP) was calculated for each group (CO
and aMCI, npAD-MCI, and pAD-MCI) and, for a topographical
assessment, we integrated the EEG signals in a map by using
the time points demonstrating a different GMFP activity between
the groups (Delorme and Makeig, 2004). To evaluate the event related changes in the frequency domain, the event-related
spectral perturbation (ERSP) and intertrial coherence (ITC) were
calculated (Delorme and Makeig, 2004). We extracted the average
ERSP and ITC for alpha (8–13 Hz), beta (13.5–30 Hz), and
gamma (30.5–80 Hz, excluding 45–55 Hz band due to notch
filtering application) frequency bands. To possibly detect the
simple features able in differentiating pAD-MCI from npAD MCI both at the group and at the individual level, we extracted
three additional metrics from the GMFP of each aMCI patient:
(i) the number of significant local maxima (# of peaks), calculated
following the methodology used in Massimini et al., 2005; (ii)
the average GMFP level [average dipolar activity (aDA)]; and (iii)
the SD of the GMFP [stability of the dipolar activity (sDA)]. We
defined these metrics “aDA” and “sDA” since a GMFP sample
(i.e., the absolute value of the EEG signals across all the electrodes
in a specific time point) can be interpreted as the instantaneous
dipolar activity on the scalp. High GMFP values result from the
group of electrodes with highly positive (positive pole) and/or
negative values (negative pole), while low GMFP values reflect
the weak poles (electrode values ? 0). Thus, aDA indicates the
average power of the dipolar activity, while sDA measures the
variations of the dipolar activity power over time.
Statistical analyses were performed as follows. Gender
differences between the groups were evaluated by the Fisher’s
exact test. The Mann–Whitney U test was used to compare

To test accuracy, the Clinical and Laboratory Standard Institute recommends having at least 50 cases to assess sensitivity and 50 controls to assess specificity. However, this study does not satisfy such sample size. To provide information about the precision of their estimates, 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated.

They applied Wilson’s method, which allows calculating CIs even in the case of 100% sensitivity and specificity, differently from the binomial exact method.

The parameters showing the highest sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were sDA and gamma ITC.

To investigate the robustness of their classification model, they performed an evaluation based on the progressive random drop of trials, repeated 100 times for each drop percentage, and the reproduction of all the steps required to build and test the classifiers from the extraction of the parameters which performed best.",,"they used a binary, linear classification model with support vector machines, dual stochastic gradient descent, and ridge regularization to evaluate the predictors of conversion to Alzheimer's disease",

,,,"27 subjects with
MCI, who at initial examination did not fulfill NINCDS ADRDA criteria for probable AD [20] and did not have evidence of deterioration in social or occupational function ing. These subjects performed at least 1 SD below average
for their age on neuropsychological tests representing one or
more areas of cognition, as was described previously [18].
General levels of cognition were assessed by Mini-Mental
Test Examination (MMSE) and Full-Scale Intelligence
Quotient [14,36].
For the baseline comparisons of EEG variables, we in cluded 2 reference groups comprising 15 AD patients diag nosed according to the NINCDS-ADRDA criteria and 16
healthy control subjects. The demographic data of the study
groups are presented in Table 1. All groups had a similar
mean age and education. All patients and healthy subjects
underwent general medical, neurological, psychiatric, and
neuropsychological investigation, as well as neuroimaging
diagnostic procedures, such as magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) and single photon emission computerized tomogra phy (SPECT). No subject received psychotropic medication
that may influence EEG recordings.
The healthy control group comprised volunteers who
were either healthy family members (spouses) of patients
investigated at the Geriatric Clinic, Huddinge University
Hospital or healthy subjects recruited to the Driving and
Aging project through advertisements. Exclusion criteria
included any chronic systemic illness, any psychiatric or
neurologic disease, family history of dementia, prior history
of alcoholism, previous head trauma, and psychotropic
medication.
The MCI subjects were followed clinically and by serial
EEG recordings. The clinical follow-up consisted of phys ical examinations, functional status assessments, and ex tended neuropsychological examinations. EEG was re corded on two occasions with an average interval of 21
months (range 12–39 months).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
